# Setting contrast matrices for factors

* see: https://marissabarlaz.github.io/portfolio/contrastcoding/
* Default for unordered factors is treatment/dummy
* We typically want centered orthogonal, and unit weighted.
- We will use a running example of a factor, $x$, with three levels. We put $x$ in a dataframe to match our typical workflows
- We then follow with several examples of setting and applying contrasts to $x$

## Sample data
```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
d <- tibble(x = factor(rep(c("A","B", "C"), 4)))
d
```

## Default contrasts


The default contrasts for factors in R as set and viewed using `options()`

- They are contr.treatment (i.e., dummy codes) for unordered factors
- They are contr.poly for ordered factors
- We do not tend to change these defaults but instead explicitly set other contrasts when we need them
```{r}
options("contrasts")
```

We can confirm the contrasts set by default for $x$ as follows

- They are dummy codes
- They are named for the level being contrasted with refererence 
```{r}
contrasts(d$x)
```

## Base R approach for other contrasts

We set contrasts using the `contrasts()` function as well.  We *could* use base R functions that define contrast matrices for classic contrasts as well

- But the coefficients aren't united weighted (my preference)
- And the contrasts aren't given descriptive labels
```{r}
contrasts(d$x) <- contr.helmert(levels(d$x))
contrasts(d$x)
```


## An improved approach


We tweak this approach to get unit weights (only for Helmert) and meaningful contrast labels

- First we get the contrast matrix (same as above)
```{r}
c3 <- contr.helmert(levels(d$x))
c3
```

- Then we adjust to make coefficients unit-weighted.  This simply requires dividing each column by its range.  You could put this in a loop if you had more columns.  We generally only do this for helmert or other orthogonal contrasts. 
```{r}
c3[, 1] <- c3[, 1] / (max(c3[, 1]) - min(c3[, 1]))
c3[, 2] <- c3[, 2] / (max(c3[, 2]) - min(c3[, 2]))
```

- Now assign names to the columns to label the contrasts
```{r}
colnames(c3) <- c("BvA", "CvBA")
c3
```

- And now assign these contrasts to $x$
```{r}
contrasts(d$x) <- c3
contrasts(d$x)
```


## Available contrasts

The contrasts we use most regularly are 

- Dummy contrasts (`contr.treatment()`).  These are set by default to unordered factors
- Helmert contrasts (`contrl.helmert()`). 
- Effects constrasts (`contr.sum()`).  We do not generally unit weight these
